      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My goal for my website is to sell bicycles.
        My friend Adam buys used or almost new bicycles.  He fixes them.  Then he sells them to make extra money.  He needs a website as a storefront to advertise and sell his bicycles.
        I want to build a website he can use to show pictures and information of his bikes.  I want the website to also be a way the customers can contact him and ask questions about his bikes.

We have a large variety of bikes for all age groups.

Types of bikes
•	Road Bikes—They have drop down handlebars and skinny tires.  The handlebars are very light weight and aerodynamic.  The frame is also very lightweight.  The more expensive versions are made from carbon and cost several thousand dollars.  Their uses are racing, touring, fitness riding, long-distance rides and daily commuting. Price is from $800 to $10,000.
•	Mountain bikes—are designed with excellent braking and shock-absorbing features which help them to handle the obstacles encountered on trails such as rocks, dirt trails, roots and ruts.  They are also meant to deal with steeper terrain.  They have knobby and wider tires which give them traction with rugged terrain.  Prices from $700 to $6,000.
•	Touring bikes—are designed for long distance travel.  They have attachment points which allow you to attach fenders, pumps, lights, racks, water bottles, saddle bags and so much more. Price $600 to $1,000.
•	Folding bikes—these bikes have a folding frame, handlebar and saddle and carried in a carry bag which allows the rider to fold them when they need them to take less space such as on a subway, bus, boat or in a home with limited storage space. Price $400 to 5,000
•	BMX—Bicycle Motor Cross—are single speed bikes used to race around a dirt track with obstacles.  They have one speed and 20-inch wheel. Price $400 to $700
•	Recumbent bike—This a non-traditional bike.  It is lower than a normal bike almost sitting on the ground.  There are different configurations with long or short wheelbases and varieties of two, three or four wheelers as well as under and above seat steering. Price $1,500 to 2,500.
•	Cruiser—these bikes are meant of leisurely rides someone would take around the town or neighborhood.  They sometimes have wider seats for better comfort and relaxed seating positions.  Prices $400 to $1,000
•	Hybrid Bike—This bike is a combination of road, mountain and touring bike designs.  They are do-it-all kind of bikes and can be used for many different uses.  Many are commuter-friendly and have fenders, racks and lighting systems.  Since hybrid bikes have so many different uses it is important to know what biking requirements you have so you can have the best fit. Price $500 to $1,800
•	Electric Bike—These bikes have an electric motor in them that can be charged at night.  They are growing in popularity.  There are mountain, road and hybrid versions available.  They make biking easier, but still give a great workout. Price $1,500 to $2,000
